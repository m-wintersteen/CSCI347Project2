In order to analyze the data, we chose to randomly remove much of the graph, and then use the \textbf{connected\_component\_subgraphs} function. This is because when we just used the \textbf{connected\_component\_subgraphs} function the subgraph still had around 700000 edges. The resulting subgraph is small enough for us to work with, but still contains a good snapshot of the original dataset.
